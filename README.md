# DH150-Assignment7
## Description and Purpose:
This project is based off of the site ‘Craigslist’. Craigslist is a website that functions as an online marketplace and community that allows users to buy and/or sell items, discuss on forums, find housing, and explore jobs. However, Craigslist is mainly known and used for their online marketplace, specifically, buying and selling items. This project will focus on the searching aspect when buying items on the website. The prototyped site will demonstrate improvements in the overall interface design, the ability to quickly find information, and safety features when looking at posts. 
 
 
 
 

## Screen Designs

## Process of the prototyping phase:


The initial step in the prototyping phase was to recreate the entire look of the site. The previous site was cluttered with words and was difficult to navigate through. However, it was important to retain features of the previous site in order for long time users to intuitively use and accept the new site. The next steps were to re categorize all  the sections and create smaller categories. Then, the categories were paired with images to help the user more easily identify the groups. Afterwards, the postings page of the site was refined and simplified, and there is an added function “Craigslist’s Picks’ to help prevent scams and dangerous situations. Finally, the item’s post page was simplified to make the information, specifically, the contact information of the seller. 





## List of tasks the interactive prototype supports:


  * Going back to the home page
  
  * Searching through categories on the home/main page
  
  * Filtering posts 
  
  * Using ‘Craigslist’s Picks’ Function
  
  * Change location page
  
  * Scrolling through options on home page
  
  * Looking at posts
  
  * Favoriting the posts





## Graphical Interface Design


In this prototype, the graphical interface was heavily altered from that original site in order to create easier navigation through the site. The categories of the site were condensed into larger groups and were replaced with images. The images will allow the users to more easily recognize the different categories on the front page, rather than a jumble of words. This decision was a result of researching through numerous sites, such as amazon, facebook, and ebay. These popular sites mainly used images to help users quickly recognize the products they are selling. 
 
 
The color scheme of this prototype was based off of the craigslist logo. Their logo cannot be found within the site, so to continue that tradition I did not use the logo. However, I used the color of the logo to design the site. The site mainly uses different shades of purple, white, and grey. There is high contrast between the dark purple and the white lettering to help those who have color blindness. Additionally, there are pops of orange, which highly contrasts with purple, to emphasize specific buttons. Finally, the blue lettering of the posts and the post style are retained from the previous site to provide long time users a sense of familiarity.

Findings:


When doing the cognitive walkthrough, the site functioned properly and all three personas were able to find a post that they were interested in purchasing. However, throughout the walkthrough, there are many clickable buttons, pages, and images, but majority of these were not linked to anything due to this being a prototype. As a result, this was not completely able to simulate how users search around to look for different posts. Another finding was that the site was more difficult to navigate through since all the clickables could not be clicked, causing slight confusion. Additionally, the search bar is not supported by this version of the prototype, therefore, the users may have clicked through the site in an unfamiliar way. Finally, when using the filters, they do not stay checked after updating. This can cause some confusion to the users, causing them to think that the posts were not filtered. 





## Reflection


The process of creating a website from scratch was very difficult. The time that it took to create a functioning prototype website took much longer than I had expected. The interface was not super difficult to use, however, when different lays began to stack and hover options were added for each pressable button, things became much more confusing. Additionally, when creating ‘animated’ or popups for the screen, it was much more difficult than I thought because every step had to be a new page. Then these pages were connected to create an animated look. However, I was not too happy with the result of these animated buttons. The animation was not as smooth as I would have liked it to be. 
 
 
Although the testing did not mention much about the overall design of the site, I would like to further improve the look of the site and improve the interface. I would like to further look into colors and accessibility to create a more vibrant site. Additionally, it would help if the prototype had more functions that the user could click through rather than the specified directions that only fulfilled my three persona’s difficulties.
